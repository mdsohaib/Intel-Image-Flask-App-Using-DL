  <h2> <i> Intel Image Classification </i> </h2>
<p><i> IN THIS PROJECT. WE WILL BE WORKING ON INTEL IMAGES I.E. IMAGES OF BUILDINGS, FOREST. STREET, ETC. WE WILL BUILD A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK AND TRAIN IT ON THESE IMAGES. THIS IS A MULTI-CLASS CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM AND WE WILL USE KERAS.</p>

<br>
 

<br>


  <h2> The Steps to solve the problem </h2>

<p>

1. MOUNTING GOOGLE DRIVE ON COLLAB NOTEBOOK. <br>
2. VISUALIZING THE IMAGES THAT WE WILL BE WORKING ON. <br>
3. ANALYZING THE DIMESNIONS TO VERIFY IF ALL IMAGES HAVE SAME DIMENSIONS. <br>
4. CONVERTING THE IMAGES INTO A NUMPY ARRAY AND NORMALIZE THEM. <br>
5. CHECKING CLASS IMBALANCE. <br>
6. SPLITTING THE DATA AND PERFORMING ONE-HOT ENCODING. <br>
7. CREATING THE MODEL ARCHITECTURE, COMPILING THE MODEL AND THEN FITTING IT. <br>
8. PLOTTING THE ACCURACY AND LOSS AGAINST EACH EPOCH. <br>
9. PREPROCESSING THE TEST DATA AND MAKE PREDICTIONS ON IT. <br>
10. VISUALIZING THE ORIGINAL AND PREDICTED LABELS FOR THE TEST IMAGES. </p>
  
<br><br>
<p><i>THIS PROJECT CAN BE USED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO CREATE NETWORK ARCHITECTURE FOR A CNN MODEL. YOU CAN FURTHER HYPERPARAMETER TUNE THIS MODEL TO REACH HIGHER ACCURACY.

THIS PROJECT HAS A VAST SCOPE, IT CAN BE USED TO CLASSIFY SATELLITE IMAGES, DRONE IMAGES, GOOGLE IMAGES INTO DIFFERENT CLASSES LIKE SEA, MOUNTAIN, ETC. </p>

  <h2> <i>Flask Web App  </i> </h2>
<p><i>SThis is the second part where we build the web application using the framework Flask We mount the model we build in the previous part on the Flask project</p>
